## Creators or Contributors
| Guideline | Example |

If individuals are significant in some way to the content of an item, consider adding a Name. In general, only include names as structured subjects if a surname is known. If only a first name, given names or nickname is known, include the name in the [Description](https://github.com/yorkulibraries/yudl-map/blob/main/metadata-input-guidelines/description.md) field or the [Title](https://github.com/yorkulibraries/yudl-map/blob/main/metadata-input-guidelines/title.md) of the work.  

Where possible, enter names following instructions as laid out in [RAD Chapter 22: Headings for Persons](http://www.cdncouncilarchives.ca/RAD/RAD_Chapter22_March2008.pdf) or as documented in authorities such as [VIAF](https://viaf.org/).

All names added as subject keywords should follow the same format:

| Guideline | Example |
| --------- | ------- |
| Invert the name (Family name, Given name ) | <ul><li>Cooper, Dale</li></ul> |
| Use any known part of the name including initials if the full name is unknown | <ul><li>Ware, K.</li></ul> |
| Include additional names as middle names | |
| Names that are hyphenated or have multiple parts are all considered "last names" | <ul><li>Sainte-Marie, Buffy</li></ul> |
| Use appropriate abbreviations: include known titles before the first name, include known suffixes at the end of the name after a second comma | <ul><li>Cumberbatch, B. Lieutenant</li><li>Cumberbatch, B. Lady</li></ul>|
| Nicknames can be included in parentheses, unless their nickname is included in authority listings like VIAF. | <ul><li>Vig, Butch </li></ul> |
| If a person is identified with both a married name and a previous name, use a separate named person entry for each surname | <ul><li>Weldon, Lois</li><li>Marshall, Lois</li></ul>|
| If a person performs or whose public life is connected with a particular name or pseudonym, use that name|<ul><li>Lady Gaga **OR** Gaga, Lady</li><li>**NOT** Germanotta, Stefani Joanne</li><li>Peck, Orville</li><li>K'naan</li><li>**NOT** Warsame, Keinan Abdi</li>|
| If a person is affiliated with the subject of the object but is not directly involved, do not add their name as a Name subject | <ul><li>Depictions of a parade in honour of Martin Luther King Jr. Day should **NOT** have a Name keyword for King, Martin Luther, 1929-1968</li><li>A photograph taken at a statue of Champlain should **NOT** have a Name keyword for Champlain, Samuel de, 1574-1635</li><li>Instead, consider adding a Geographic term for the location or subject topic, eg. Samuel de Champlain Monument (Orillia,Ont.)</li><li>A photograph taken at an Ada Lovelace Day Edit-a-thon should NOT include a Name subject for Ada Lovelace, 1815-1852</li></ul>|
