# How the Creators and Contributors field works in the metadata form

* Complex field parts:
  * Relationship Type
    * Dropdown
  * Creator
    * Autocomplete text field
* Repeatable
* Not required

# How should the creator be filled in?

* Name fields are connected to the Person, Family, or Corporate Body vocabularies.
  * Editors should always choose a value from the list if it is available.
  * If a value is not available, contact the system administrators. 
* The creator field is not constrained by the AACR2 practice of limiting creators to three or fewer names.
  * Include as many creators and roles as are readily available.
* If the creator has multiple roles, repeat the name for each role.
* The creator roles come from the Library of Congress [MARC Code List for Relators Scheme](https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators.html).
  * Not all of the Library of Congress roles are included.
  * If a role is not available, contact the system administrators.
