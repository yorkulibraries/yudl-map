# If it is difficult to determine the resource type:

* Consult the categories in the Library of Congress "[Specific Material Form Term List](https://www.loc.gov/standards/valuelist/marcsmd.html)"
* Consider whether it fits one of these scenarios:
  * Page images of textual items should be entered as "Text" not "Image"
  * A series of negatives should be entered as "nonprojected graphic, photonegative"
  * A series of photo prints should be entered as "nonprojected graphic, photoprint"
* A page with both text and images should be entered based on which portion is most dominant or important, i.e.,
  * Does it seem like "text" with accompanying images(s) â€“ e.g., photos or illustrations in a letter or printed page?
  * Does it seem like "photograph(s)" or "illustrations" with inscriptions and accompanying text?
* Consider whether someone would expect to find the item if they limit their search to one particular type
