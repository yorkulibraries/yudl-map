# How the title field work in the metadata form

* Text area
* Not repeatable
* Required

## How should the title be filled in?

* Every record must have a Main Title, also called an “official title”
* Some records may have alternative or multiple titles, if so, please use the "Alternative Title" field in conjunction with this field.

| Guidelines | Examples |
| ---------- | -------- |
| <ul><li>Write out the title the way it appears</li><li>Do not put the call number, file name, or other identification numbers in the title</li></ul> | |
| <ul><li>Capitalize the first word and proper nouns</li><li>Keep other capitalization the same as it is found on the item</li><li>If the title is taken from a catalog, copy the capitalization from the record</li><li>Use the same capitalization for all titles in a record unless there is a reason not to do so (e.g., authorized series titles)</li></ul> | |
| <ul><li>Change Roman numerals to Arabic numbers (Add a note with the Roman numerals)</li><li>Write out numbers through 100</li><li>An alternate title can be added if the numbers are important to the title</li></ul> | |
| <ul><li>Write out abbreviations or acronyms</li><li>An alternate title with the abbreviations may be added, or a display note for common abbreviations such as "vol."</li></ul> | |
| <ul><li>Separate titles and subtitles with a colon</li></ul> | |
| <ul><li>Commas may be used to separate long titles</li><li>Separate parts with periods if they are used in the item</li></ul> | |
| <ul><li>It is preferred that titles include more than a personal name only (for portraits or items that do not have titles), e.g., "John J. Moore"</li><li>In cases where an item has been given a title that is only a proper name (except for books or published texts), create a more descriptive title in brackets (the original title can be an alternate or added title if it is important to include it)</li></ul> | |
| If there is no title: <ul><li>Use a title for the item found in a library catalog or similar resource (including OCLC Worldcat)</li><li>Create one; it must be enclosed in [square brackets] and should be both succinct and descriptive</li></ul> | |
| For some materials, we often use a standardized format, e.g.:<ul><li>For letters: [Letter from {name} to {name}, {date}]</li><li>Separate correspondence information from date with a comma or dash</li><li>Write out dates to be "human readable" when adding them to titles</li><li>If the items are related to court cases: Documents pertaining to the case of {names/case name}, cause No. #, {date}</li><li>For clippings: [Clipping: {article title}]</li><li>For funeral programs: [Funeral Program for {full name}, {date of funeral}]</li><li>For invoice/receipt: [{Invoice/Receipt} for {{{item/summary}}}, {date}]</li><li>(For serials, see Special Titles below)</li></ul> | |
| Standardized formats may be adjusted as needed to appropriately fit the item, e.g.:<ul><li>If some information is unknown (generally omit) or if all of the usual details are unknown</li><li>Business or organizational correspondence (e.g., form letters) that may not have individual correspondents</li><li>If there are multiple items (such as a reply added to the bottom of a letter or multiple clippings on a sheet of paper)</li><li>To make titles more unique</li></ul> | |
