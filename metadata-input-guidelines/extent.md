# Definition

Extent is the physical examination of the object, and generally includes:
  * physical dimensions
  * pagination
  * printing methods or process (tintype, daguerrotype, woodcut, etc.)

# How the extent field work in the metadata form

* Text area
* Repeatable
* Not required

# How should the extent be filled in?

* Enter physical descriptions including: dimensions, extent, pagination, and related physical and process details.
* When possible, follow the conventions established in RAD 1.5B including exact punctionation (**extent : physical details ; dimensions + accompanying materials**).
* When dimensions are given, specify the units, e.g., "cm." for centimeters or "in." for inches.
